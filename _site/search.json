I designed a product for Dez, a person who found their skin-care routine an important part of their morning routine. Dez shared how they were frustrated with the process of choosing skin care products for this routine because these products were expensive and may not actually help their skin. In response, I designed an information booklet that could be attached to skin care products that shared information about its impacts on people’s skin. See Product Features for more details.\nAt the end of the project I shared my designed booklet with Dez and tested how the booklet influenced her feelings towards buying a hypothetical skin care product. They shared that my designed booklet made them feel pretty confident about purchasing the product because it was transparent and honest.\n\nProduct Features\n\nA price scale to show how the price compares to other products\nA product description to share what the product does\nKey ingredients and a description of what they do\nTwo user reviews with\n\nTheir picture, name, and age\nInformation about the user’s skin\nA quote sharing how long they used the product and how it affected their skin\nBefore and after pictures\n\n^ One positive review and one review suggesting another product in the same skin care line\nA page for other suggested products based on a person’s skin type\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Process\n\nBackground and Empathizing\nThis project started as a choose-your-own-adventure within the scope of designing for a person’s morning routine. To help get a sense of what self-care routines looked like in general, I participated in doing live interviews in the Claremont Village with my Human-Centered Design class. We chose the Claremont Village since it had many health and beauty businesses within a small area. I then conducted five interviews on my own with friends and family to better understand what a morning routine looked like, and places it could be improved.\n\n\nNeedfinding and Ideating\nI then used these interviews to identify two types of people (users) I wanted to create a product for. I highlighted who they were, what they needed, and an insight from their interview that could help address this need. Next, I came up with questions on how I would address their needs and insight. I used these questions to come up with ideas for potential products (and using Chat-GPT 3.5 for assistance). I chose to prototype a booklet with key features about a skin care product.\n\n\n\nPrototyping\nI chose each of these features to help users have a better understanding of how the product may affect their skin type. Each feature is meant to make it easier for users to understand if a product works for them. If the product doesn’t seem to match their needs, there are suggested products they can look at next.\n\n\nTesting\nFinally, I tested my product with my user, one of the people I wanted to create a product for. We did the product test over FaceTime. During the test, I had the user imagine they were buying a skin care product in a health and beauty store. I then introduced the booklet and had them share how the booklet impacted their feelings about buying the skin care product.\n\n\n\nReflection\nOverall, my user said they felt pretty confident about purchasing the product because the booklet was transparent and honest. She also felt that buyers are worried about what products they buy. Buyers may go to extreme lengths to figure out what a product will do, even if they have to brave negative skin effects.\nTherefore, it was impactful to simply know what a product would do to her skin before risking her skin health."

In my game, players are a ball of light. Using the WASD or IJKL arrow keys, they must try to get to the yellow ball in the distance. However, they must beware of the enemies that stand in their way: a sneaky krill and mischievous crabs who want to steal their light.\nMy favorite parts were programming the glow effect under the player, building the characters, and creating the space theme in the game.\nTo win: Reach the yellow light in the distance before a crab touches it To lose: Crab reaches the light first or player gets thrown of the map by a krill\n\nObstacles\nCrab nest: If the crab enters the crab cave, it will call for back up. A horde of crabs will surround the player. If the player touches then, they will be teleported to a random spot on the map. Be careful not to get trapped in the nest!\nKrill: An enemy that will follow the player if they enter its blue circle. If the player is hit, they will be thrown off the map.\n\n\nControls\nWASD / IJKL: movement up, left, down, right\nM / m: set speed to zero\nN / n: float upwards\nE / e: float downwards\nSpace: teleport to center of map\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\nKrill Attack\n\n\n\n\nPlayer entered the Krill’s circle.\n\n\n\nGame Play\n\n\n\n\nPlayer lost their light and lost the game."

MUSE is a tool for people to better understand how different parts of sound relate to each other. This is to provide a foundation for those interested in producing music. We help visualize these different parts by associating sound with color.\nSo, instead of playing music tracks, users can play colors as sounds. Users can change the tint and saturation of the colors using sliders. These sliders also impact the sound of the color - changing tint changes the speed, and changing saturation changes the volume. This allows users to see the visual impacts of changing parts of sound. We hope that by connecting a visual change with altering sound, users can better understand how the speed and volume change a music track.\nUsers can play two colors at once to create a sound mixture and save them.\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\nWelcome Page\n\n\n\n\nOur welcome screen with the logo designed by Eshanya.\n\n\n\nMain Page\n\n\n\n\nUsers select one of the colors in the middle of the screen to play on each of the larger disks.\nThe colors on the disks mix and show up as the smaller disk between the large ones.\n\n\n\nSaved Colors Page\n\n\n\n\nHere users can see all of the color mixtures they have saved.\n\n\n\nHelp Page\n\n\n\n\nTeaches users how to use MUSE."
