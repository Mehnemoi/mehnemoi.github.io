    "text": "Personal Care Project\n\n\nKaitlynn Gray\n\n\nCourse: Human Centered Design\nTools: Empathizing, Defining, Ideating, Prototyping, Testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis project focused on designing a product to improve a person’s morning routine. I designed a product for Dez, a person who found their skin-care routine an important part of their morning routine. Dez shared how they were frustrated with the process of choosing skin care products for this routine because these products were expensive and may not actually help their skin. In response, I designed an information booklet that could be attached to skin care products that shared information about its impacts on people’s skin. See Product Features for more details.\nAt the end of the project I shared my designed booklet with Dez and tested how the booklet influenced her feelings towards buying a hypothetical skin care product. They shared that my designed booklet made them feel pretty confident about purchasing the product because it was transparent and honest.\n\nProduct Features\n\nA price scale to show how the price compares to other products\nA product description to share what the product does\nKey ingredients and a description of what they do\nTwo user reviews with\n\nTheir picture, name, and age\nInformation about the user’s skin\nA quote sharing how long they used the product and how it affected their skin\nBefore and after pictures\n\n^ One positive review and one review suggesting another product in the same skin care line\nA page for other suggested products based on a person’s skin type\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Process\n\nBackground and Empathizing\nThis project started as a choose-your-own-adventure within the scope of designing for a person’s morning routine. To help get a sense of what self-care routines looked like in general, I participated in doing live interviews in the Claremont Village with my Human-Centered Design class. We chose the Claremont Village since it had many health and beauty businesses within a small area. I then conducted five interviews on my own with friends and family to better understand what a morning routine looked like, and places it could be improved.\n\n\nNeedfinding and Ideating\nI then used these interviews to identify two types of people (users) I wanted to create a product for. I highlighted who they were, what they needed, and an insight from their interview that could help address this need. Next, I came up with questions on how I would address their needs and insight. I used these questions to come up with ideas for potential products (and using Chat-GPT 3.5 for assistance). I chose to prototype a booklet with key features about a skin care product.\n\n\n\nPrototyping\nI chose each of these features to help users have a better understanding of how the product may affect their skin type. Each feature is meant to make it easier for users to understand if a product works for them. If the product doesn’t seem to match their needs, there are suggested products they can look at next.\n\n\nTesting\nFinally, I tested my product with my user, one of the people I wanted to create a product for. We did the product test over FaceTime. During the test, I had the user imagine they were buying a skin care product in a health and beauty store. I then introduced the booklet and had them share how the booklet impacted their feelings about buying the skin care product.\n\n\n\nReflection\nOverall, my user said they felt pretty confident about purchasing the product because the booklet was transparent and honest. She also felt that buyers are worried about what products they buy. Buyers may go to extreme lengths to figure out what a product will do, even if they have to brave negative skin effects.\nTherefore, it was impactful to simply know what a product would do to her skin before risking her skin health."

    "text": "Gradescope Calendar UI Design\n\n\nKaitlynn Gray, Caleb Wheeler, Arisa Cowe\n\n\nProject: Harvey Mudd College Summer Start-Up\nTools: React, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext\nGradescope Calendar is a website my team and I created that organizes due dates from Gradescope, an online tool where instructors can assign assignments and exams. We created, programmed, practiced pitching, and presented this project under the Summer Start-Up program during our Summer 2022 research project at Harvey Mudd College.\n\n\nProblem\nProposed by my teammate Caleb Wheeler, our team shared frustrations with interacting with Gradescope for our college assignments. Many of our college courses used Gradescope to communicate assignment due dates. However, we needed to manually go into each course page to see each due date to plan for our assignments. This became tedious over the semester, as it required us to consistently check each page to ensure we didn’t miss assignments.\nOur team created Gradescope Calendar so students can see all of their upcoming Gradescope assignments in one place at one time.\nWhile others have created similar projects, such as one titled “Gradescope Scheduler,” ours was unique as it relied on providing users with a visual representation of their assignments that they could interact with. Gradescope Scheduler required users to use the terminal to obtain their Gradescope data, which reduced the accessibility of their product. Our project desired to promote ease of use by only requiring users to log in using their Gradescope credentials.\n\n\nDesign Process\n\n\nUI Overview\nI designed the first iteration of the monthly calendar and weekly overview in Canva. These designs included the base-level information our website should display, including buttons to download the calendar to Google or Apple Calendar and sign out.\n\nColor\n\n\n\n\nColor palette generated in Coolors.co. Source\n\n\n\n\n\nGradescope’s 2022 Logo. Image source\n\n\n\nI wanted to create a visual tie between our website and Gradescope through using the color and font from the Gradescope logo. I used my favorite color palette generator website, coolors.co to create a palette based off of the key green color used in the Gradescope logo and website. I then researched fonts that looked similar to the font used in the Gradescope logo to use in our website. I opted to douse the background in the key Gradescope green to emphasize the connection between our website and Gradescope.\nI needed to make sure that the colors I chose would be distinguishable if our users had some level of color blindness. I used the color blindness tool in coolors to see how the colors may appear to those with different color perceptions to ensure the palette would be accessible to these users.\n\n\nStructure\nMy designs consistently include elements with round borders which may make it feel more inviting to interact with our website. Since this background was vibrant, I wanted to make sure users could still focus on our presented content. Thus, each grouping of content was placed in white containers with a box shadow to make it seem it was floating off the screen. This would allow the user to focus on the content and still experience the Gradescope green background.\n\n\n\nMonthly Calendar\n\nInitial Design\n\nWhen designing the monthly calendar, I opted for a standard calendar layout where each date displayed thin cards representing assignments due that day. This way, users could immediately see which days had assignments due, and better prepare for assignment heavy days. Users would be able to click tabs below the calendar to highlight assignments from specific classes. This way, users could still have the option of focusing on assignment deadlines for one class.\nI then included a side panel with information about the assignments due that week organized by day. This included the course of the assignment and its due time.\nMy teammate Arisa Cowe programmed the Monthly Overview UI into our app:\n\n\n\nIteration!\n\n\n\n\nFirst iteration of the Monthly Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond iteration of the Monthly Calendar\n\n\n\nI liked how this implementation made use of the entire screen. However, I noticed how users would have to scroll through each date in the calendar to view all assignments. I also noticed that the date and assignment list looked very similar in the side panel.\nIn my next iteration of the monthly overview, I wanted to use more space, like in the above implementation, make it clearer to see all the assignments within each calendar square, and make a clearer distinction between the date and list of assignments in the side panel\nOn the calendar side, I expanded the space for the calendar, included the day of the week at the top of the calendar, and introduced cards that would squish to fill the space in each square. This way, users would know what day the assignment was due and see all the assignments without scrolling.\nThe side panel saw the most change. I alternated the background colors for each list item to more clearly see each assignment. I then included the full course name shown on Gradescope so users can accurately match the information presented here and on Gradescope itself. Finally, I separated the due time for each assignment and aligned them to the right so users could view the due times (the most important information) in one glance.\n\n\n\nWeekly Overview\n\nInitial Design\n\nI designed the weekly overview to display more information about the assignments shown in the side panel and allow for more interactivity with the assignments.\nI wanted to use a table to align the class name, assignment, and time due while keeping this information spaced out for clear viewing. This way, users could move their eyes to their section of choice (ex: time due), and glance up or down to see more information under this category. Each day would be highlighted in the light teal bar on that date, so users could be visually directed to the assignments due that day.\nThe key motivation behind Gradescope Calendar was to get key information about assignments and their due dates to users faster. Therefore, I highlighted the time due column in teal so users could quickly find this information. I also included a next assignment widget to the right so users could immediately see the next assignment that needs their attention.\n\n\nIteration! Part One\n\n\n\n\nFirst iteration of the Weekly Overview\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond iteration of the Weekly Overview\n\n\n\nIn this next iteration I wanted to allow for users to interact with the list items. I included a design for a crossing out and highlighting function. For instance, if a user finished an assignment, I wanted them to be able to cross out that line and gray-out the text to reduce visual attention to that line. Or, if a student wanted to prioritize a selection of assignments, I wanted them to be able to select and highlight that line so they were visually drawn to that line. I designed a second widget on the right displaying the selected assignments and the time remaining until its due date.\nI also wanted to distinguish quizzes and exams from general homework to highlight when these significant tasks were approaching. To do this, I highlighted rows with quizzes and exams in orange. Orange contrasts with the teal, causing users to be drawn to this line and become aware of this important information.\n\n\nIteration! Part Two\n\n\n\n\nSecond iteration of the Weekly Overview\n\n\n\n\n\nThird iteration of the Weekly Overview\n\n\n\nI incorporated alternating list highlighting in the same light teal shown on the monthly overview page. So, I updated the color of selected assignments to the light green as it helped distinguish alternating lines from selected lines and was not associated with a course.\nI included an “all courses” widget with a button for each of the user’s courses. Each included large rectangular backgrounds to convey to the user that they were clickable buttons. The background colors matched the colors each course was associated with on the monthly overview page. When clicked, the button would become the concentrated color displayed on their left border to communicate to the user that assignments from these courses would be highlighted (see the “Introduction to Biology” button under the “all courses” widget). The respective courses in the weekly overview list would also be highlighted in this concentrated color to create a visual tie between the action (clicking the button) and result (highlighting the respective courses).\nWith these additions, Gradescope Calendar could be more than a calendar - it could be a tool to track completed assignments and help draw attention to specific assignments to focus on.\n\n\n\n\nEnd Product\n\n\nMy final design is the most effective as it leans more into placing key information towards the top of the page: the current day/week/month and upcoming assignments. The visual design is clean - the bright white boxes focus the user on the main content, while the large margins between content help to split up all the information presented to the user. This allows them to feel less overwhelmed with the amount of information. Furthermore, interactions with the list items can be clearly distinguished.\nI included more information about the current time period, buttons to navigate to past and future weeks. I included the month and year at the top with the specific week range so users would know the exact week they were looking at when navigating to past and future weeks. To complement this functionality, I placed a “today’s date” widget at the top right. Thus, users could keep track of the current date as they flipped between weeks. Since Gradescope Calendar has a foundation as a calendar, I wanted to ensure information about the displayed date of assignments was clearly shown.\nOverall, this design achieved Gradescope Calendar’s goal of delivering Gradescope assignment deadlines to users faster as it displayed the assignments for all courses at once. The vibrant visuals, separation of information, and design choices to prevent assignments from blending together ensured users could visually conceptualize their Gradescope assignments and thus better prepare for their academic work schedules.\n\n\nWhat I Learned\nThis project was the first time I seriously learned how to do UI design. I only had about 2 years of design experience at this point, and many of my designs focused on being aesthetically pleasing. This project taught me to ask “why” when including elements in my designs. I needed to be intentional about the colors I used, the information I showed versus hid, and how I could guide the user through the interface. As such, I needed to do a lot of iteration. Nevertheless, I am proud of how I was able to produce a clean UI that balanced both aesthetics and effectively communicating information."

    "text": "Background\nWelcome! This is a summer research project I collaborated on in Summer 2022. My team of 3 created a product called Gradescope Calendar to help with Gradescope assignment organization at the Claremont Colleges in California. Gradescope is a platform where teachers can assign homework, quizzes, and tests to students. Students can submit these through Gradescope and recieve detailed feedback. While Gradescope makes it easy to see when assigned items are due, these items are separated by classes. Thus, students must look at one class at a time in Gradescope and track assigned items using their own methods. Gradescope Calendar streamlines this process by presenting all assigned items for all classes on one screen. All though a similar project, Gradescope Scheduler, exists, our product promoted ease of use by not requiring users to use backend processes to access the information.\n\n\n\nSee the research poster I designed for the team to learn more about the project!\n\n\nI designed the UI for the site, but my main objective was to implement the Weekly Assignments page. This page displayed all the assign items due for a specific week, separated by the day. Users could:\n\nview past and future weeks of due dates for assigned items\nclearly see when the next assignment is due\n\nand the time remaining to submit it\n\ncheck off assigned items to highlight them\ncross out assigned items to strike them out and\nhighlight assigned items by course."

If you are familiar with Gradescope, you will notice the iconic Gradescope green used as a primary color throughout. I intentionally chose this color scheme to create a strong visual tie to the Gradescope platform for users. This visual tie would help communicate that Gradescope Calendar was to be used alongside Gradescope, rather than be separate from.\n\n\n\n\nColor palatte (Generated on coolors.co)\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin Page\nThis image includes the current UI of the login screen, as well as one of its previous iterations for comparision.\n\n\n\nLogin page\n\n\n\n\nMonthly Overview Page\nBelow are three versions of the Monthly Overview page: the regular mode, dark mode, and the first iteration of the design. On this page users can visualize all of the assignments due for the month, including a separate window for assignments due that week. Users can use the “view by class” buttons to view assigned items for a specific class only. They could then download the calendar data to import into the digital calendar of their choice. Or, they could navigate the weekly assignents page!\n\n\n\nRegular UI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial design\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Assignments Page\n\n\nHere, I showcase three iterations of the Weekly Assignments page. The image below showcases the final version.\nBecause of how frequently I edit and update my designs, I have started a habit of keeping track of previous states. This helps me to understand how far the design has come and also have an accessible record of past assets I can use in later iterations. Most importantly, this frees me from being afraid of making major changes to the design - leading to more daring design decisions.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 1\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Version: This page displays items assigned to me earlier in the school year during the week of Feburary 6th, 2022. Here, I have highlighted all assignments from my “Introduction to Biology” class. I demonstrate the crossing-out option and checking-off functionalities.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome Page\nThis page did not end up being used, but would have served as the “face” of Gradescope Calendar. Users would see this page when navigating to the site.\n\n\n\nWelcome page"

I knew how to make basic HTML elements like divs and buttons, and how to navigate to different pages. Beyond that, not much.\nLuckily, my research advisor set us up for success. My first assignment was to create a web app using Flask.\nMy Flask app began as a single page with a table holding information about characters from Sailor Moon, my favorite series. (picture). It then evolved to have multiple pages of content where users could. Throughout this process I learned how to:\n\ncreate a button that changed another element\nuse scripting to\n\nchange the title of a page\ncontrol the CSS properties using a button\nreverse an inputed string and output the result on the screen\n\ncall actions based on what is typed into a field\ncall APIs using fetch\ncreate a dynamically resizing page\n\n\nThe images and captions below demonstrate this process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beginning state of my wesbite. Just a table with characters from Sailor Moon and their superhero name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst major CSS update of my wesbite! Added more content to my table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpanded the site to have multiple pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded more pages to my site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded even more pages to my site and added a stary background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated widget where users can input image size dimensions and recieve a link to a cat picture with those dimensions from a cat image API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated another widget where users can input a color and have the background change to match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning how to add and create function checkboxes and radio buttons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor CSS update to the site, leaning into the space and science theme. Creating a dynamicaly responsive homepage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessfully implemented Anime Quotes API!\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\nTo test my newly learned skils, I wanted to create a page that can:\n\ntake in information\nuse text boxes\ndisplay something recieved from an API\n\nSee the images and captions below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst I created an initial form to take in formation. Implemented a check box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanged what information I would request from the user. Updated the UI to bring back the space element.\n\n\n\n\n\nImplemented dynamic resizing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal version of the Welcome page with a successful implementation of a random quotes API!\n\n\nThese skills were instrumental in my developlement of the Weekly Assignments page."

How would you represent that in physical form? In this project, I was tasked to create physical representations of the concept of light, animated, and squishy. The catch: I could only use cardboard, foamcore, paper, and glue!\n\nAnimated\nWhen I think of something animated, I think of movement and changing expressions. Thus, I used dowels made from rolled paper and glue to create a piece with moving wings and a scrollable face wheel to generate 4 different expressions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight\nI took a more literal representation for this piece and created the Sun as it is a provider of light. I included a hole within to allow light to pass through the object, and rainbow-order metallic coated paper to represent how light is colorful and reflective (which, when combined with a phone flashlight leads to some cool reflections!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquishy\nFor this piece, I wanted to create something that could be physically squeezed. My final design is a pillow that can be squeezed or fluffed due to the form of the foam core inside the “pillow case.”"

    "text": "MUSE\n\n\nEshanya Agrawal, Deniz Bajin, Zariah Folkes, Kaitlynn Gray\n\n\nCourse: Computational Design Tools\nTools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n\n\nDesign Documentation\nGitHub Repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI collaborated with 3 students to apply the human-centered design process to software development.\n\n\nDescription\nMUSE is a digital DJ board website. It is a tool for people to better understand how different parts of sound relate to each other. This provides a foundation for those interested in producing music. We help visualize these different parts by associating sound with color.\nSo, instead of playing music tracks, users can play colors as sounds. Users can change the tint and saturation of the colors using sliders. These sliders also impact the sound of the color; changing tint changes the speed, and changing saturation changes the volume. This allows users to see the visual impacts of changing parts of sound. We hope that by connecting a visual change with altering sound, users can better understand how the speed and volume change a music track.\nUsers can play two colors at once to create a sound mixture and save it.\n\n\nThe MUSE DJ board. Two colors are playing, and both have been edited using the sliders.\n\n\n\nThe Process\nI came up with the initial idea of MUSE. At the beginning, I proposed we create a web application that connected music to color. When a color changed, the music would shift to express how it changed. With this, users would not have to rely on seeing a color itself, such as if they were colorblind, to understand one color’s relationship to another.\n\nUsing Human Centered Design\nMy team applied the human-centered design process to create MUSE. For the empathizing stage, I worked with my team to generate questions to understand how people associated color and sound. We also asked about their desire to produce music.\nWe interviewed one person each. We found that people had a need to understand sound instead of color. By understanding sound, people could create their own music. So, we shifted MUSE to focus on using color to understand sound.\n\n\nLow-Fidelity Prototype\nI worked with my team to create the low-fidelity prototype of MUSE in Canva below. One teammate selected a pre-made DJ board graphic and printed it. Then, I helped cut out colored pieces of paper to represent the color disks we would play on each side of the board. We also cut out smaller pieces to represent these colors mixing, and sliders to change the shade, tint, and saturation of the colors.\nWe used this prototype to create a video showing the rough functionality of MUSE. After, we brought this prototype to class to test with our classmates. I aided in taking notes while two of my teammates simulated the sounds using their voices.\n\n\n\nFigma Wireframe\nI created the Figma wireframe below of our “Saved Colors” page. Mixed and saved colors would collect here. I envisioned that users could select colors from here to bring back out to the DJ board.\n\n\n\nState Diagram\nWe created a state diagram to visualize how the user would navigate MUSE. Each square represents a state of MUSE, such as being on a certain page or selecting one of the music disks. The arrows show how users can get from one state to another.\nWith this, we could understand the interactions we were programming into MUSE.\n\n\n\nUser Goal Diagram\nMy team and I also created the below user goal diagram to see what a user would need to do, in order, to achieve their goal of using sound to understand color.\n\n\n\nUser Interface (UI) Iteration\nI polished the UI of MUSE. Deniz led the programming of the base components, allowing me to go in and make UI updates as needed. Below are the before and after of my UI updates.\nThe “before” images have been cropped on the top and bottom to align with the after images.\n\nMain Page Redesign\n\n\nBefore\n\n\nMUSE’s initial main page UI.\n\n\n\nAfter\n\n\nI updated the UI code to make MUSE look more like a DJ board. Now the design aligns closer to the DJ board we used in our low-fidelity prototype.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp Page Redesign\n\n\nBefore\n\n\nMUSE’s initial help page UI.\n\n\n\nAfter\n\n\nI updated the help page to number each step and add a Q-and-A section. This helped to guide users to specific pieces of information without having to read all of the content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Color Mixing\nUsers should be able to choose a color disk on each side and have the color mix in the smaller disk in between them. Our initial code successfully mixed colors like yellow and blue to make green, or red and yellow to make orange. However, mixing red and blue produced… green? That wasn’t right.\nSo, I took initiative and used a combination of internet resources, ChatGPT, and help from my professor during their office hours to successfully correct our code to mix colors naturally. It was ultimately an internet resource my professor found that solved our color troubles! You can view the resource here.\n\n\nYellow and purple mixing successfully.\n\n\nCurious about the color-mixing bug?\nThis happened because we were averaging the HSL values of each color to mix them. HSL values represent colors as a group of three numbers like this: (hue, saturation, lightness). These values control the hue (color), saturation (vibrancy), and lightness (brightness) of a color. Using HSL values was helpful because MUSE focused on shifting the saturation and brightness/darkness of colors.\nHue ranges from 0 to 360, like the degrees of a circle. This circle is mapped onto the color wheel, where 0 = red, 180 = cyan, and 360 = red again (source). The image below, screenshotted from the Mozilla Developers site, shows what this color wheel looks like:\n\n\n\n\nImage Source.\n\nSo, pure red would have a hue value of 0, and yellow would have a hue value around 60. If we wanted to mix these colors by averaging their hue values, we would get 30. This would correctly map onto orange!\nHowever, if we did this same process using red (hue = 0) and blue (hue = 240), we would get 120… which maps onto green! So, we needed to convert our colors to another value representation to mix them successfully. Following the source I received from my professor, I converted our colors to RGB before mixing them.\nRGB values represent how much red, green, or blue is in a color, ranging from 0 to 255, like this: (red, green, blue). For example, pure red would be (255, 0, 0) and pure blue would be (0, 0, 255). So, mixing red and blue by averaging their values would result in (128, 0, 128), which represents a color with equal amounts of red and blue, AKA purple!\nBy changing our colors from HSL to RGB before averaging their values, colors would mix naturally.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Product\n\n\nWelcome Page\n\n\n\n\nOur welcome screen with the logo designed by Eshanya.\n\n\n\nMain Page\n\n\n\n\nUsers select one of the colors in the middle of the screen to play on each of the larger disks. Zariah programmed the sound editing.\nThe colors on the disks mix and show up as the smaller disk between the large ones.\n\n\n\nSaved Colors Page\n\n\n\n\nHere, users can see all of the color mixtures they have saved.\n\n\n\nHelp Page\n\n\n\n\nTeaches users how to use MUSE.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nI learned how to apply the human-centered design process to software development. I gained experience applying insights gained from interviews and user prototyping sessions to improve our product. It was a privilege to have a group of students enjoy an idea I thought of enough to dedicate time to refining it and building a working product that brought it to life."

    "text": "APIP\n\n\nKaitlynn Gray, Rachel Lee, Erin Li, Jessica Lin, Joshua Martinez, Yuki Yang\n\n\nCourse: Computer Science Clinic (partnered with Webflow)\nTools: Webflow, React, TypeScript, CSS, Figma\n\n\nJump to Final UI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI designed the UI for APIP: The AI-Powered Inspiration Palette Tool, in collaboration with my team members and feedback from Webflow liaisons.\n\n\nBackground\nThis project was a part of the Harvey Mudd Computer Science Clinic Program, a senior capstone project program with the same weight as a thesis. Students are placed in teams and given a company partner to design a product for, with support from company liaisons.\nFor my Clinic project, I teamed with 5 Computer Science majors and the company Webflow to design a product for Webflow users. Webflow is a website-focused company where users can build, host, and optimize their websites.\n\n\nProblem\nWebflow has many tools to use to build the perfect website. However, this large array of tools, combined with a blank website canvas to work on, may lead users to feel overwhelmed and unsure where to start. Our Webflow liaisons called this the “blank slate” problem.\n\n\nA screenshot of a blank website page in the Webflow Designer.\n\nOur team addressed the blank slate problem by creating a way for users to bring in colors, fonts, and padding styles from websites they are inspired by to provide support for their Webflow website designs. To do so, we created a Chrome extension and a Webflow extension to help users upload CSS variables to the Webflow website building area: the Webflow Designer. We called our project APIP: The AI-Powered Inspiration Palette Tool (APIP).\n\n\nMotivation\n\nAfter viewing the Webflow Designer tutorials, I had an idea – what if we could take a screenshot* of a website we liked and use AI to generate code we could use to style our own websites in the same way? We could then use these styles in the Webflow Designer.\n\n\n*A few months later, I’ll end up attending a Computer Science talk and learn there is a company actually pouring time and money into that same idea – unrelated to me – right now.\n\n\nAfter much research, we learned that using AI in this way would lead to incorrect results. So, we iterated on our product until we settled on creating a Chrome and Webflow extension.\n\nWith these, users could:\n\nOpen an APIP Chrome extension while on their favorite website\nClick on styling elements they liked, and have these stored in an AI-generated .JSON file\nTake this stored information, download it, and\nUpload it into the APIP Webflow extension to use on their Webflow website!\n\n\n\nInitial Figma UI Design\nMy team member Rachel and I created a Figma wireframe that built out the team’s ideas on key features APIP would have, and how the information would be organized. In the image below, the Chrome Extension wireframe is left of the arrow, and the Webflow Extension wireframe is on the right.\n\n\nUsing Webflow UI Style\nI wanted to create a visual tie between APIP and the Webflow website by using design styles from Webflow. This way, Webflow users would know that APIP and Webflow are connected. So, I used these screenshots from the Webflow Designer as inspiration to convert our wireframe designs to match the Webflow user interface (UI).\nNote: The screenshot on the left with the variables will appear once more in the first iteration of the Webflow extension below. I use this to visualize how Webflow displays its variables to better align our UI with theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUI Redesign\nCombining the above inspiration and my research into Webflow design resources, I redesigned the team Figma wireframe to closely align with the Webflow UI style.\n\nChrome Extension\n\n\n\nWebflow Extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChrome Extension Iteration\nWith our new design direction established, we had one job left to do: refine our UI! I created the following Figma mockups to represent how our UI evolved throughout the project.\n\n1st Iteration\nAll buttons were placed at the top, allowing users to find them in one place (first image). We also opted for a default styling for the checkboxes (second image) and added a copy icon on the Export JSON page (third image). Each element received a “remove” button so users could remove specific elements (second image).\nHighlighting Feedback: Our liaisons advised that we reduce the text we use in our UI. Here, we removed the text surrounding the “convert to JSON” button by renaming it to “Convert Variables” and removing the “ready to transfer your variables?” question above it.\n\n\n\n2nd Iteration\nWe made it easier for users to see and locate their clicked elements by adding a collapse/expand feature. With a new set of buttons, we created a tie between the buttons and their uses by aligning the buttons influencing the clicked elements area (select / remove / collapse and expand) above the area and placing the “convert variables” on a different line (first and second image).\nContinuing our efforts to reduce text, we changed the “remove” button on each element to a trashcan icon. With icons, users could learn key information about button uses without needing to read each button. Here, I represent it with a red, rounded rectangle.\nHighlighting Feedback: Our liaisons also pointed out that Webflow uses sentence-case for their text. Thus, I changed the tab names, “activate element grabber” switch, and buttons to sentence case. Ex: “Style Selection” became “Style selection” instead.\n\n\n\n3rd and 4th Iterations\nHighlighting Feedback: Our liaisons advised that we move the “convert variables” button to the bottom of the page. Now, the button would be in a more intuitive area, as it was only used after a user finished choosing all elements.\nWe changed “remove all” to “delete all”. (first image and second image). Additionally, we made the collapse/expand button easier to understand by simplifying it to one carrot pointing up or down (compare the first and second images).\nWe also added a trash can icon to the delete button. This icon served as a delete button for each clicked element, so adding the icon to the new delete button created a visual tie between their uses (third image).\n\n\n\n\nWebflow Extension Iteration\n\n1st Iteration\nCompleted after I converted the initial wireframe to the Webflow UI style, we experimented with combining the import and create variables pages on the same screen.\nNote: The bottom half area, starting with “Component 1” and ending with “+ New variable,” is not my own. Instead, it is a screenshot from the Webflow Designer that I used to visualize how Webflow displays their variables! You may recognize this screenshot from the “Using Webflow Style” section above.\n\n\n\n2nd Iteration\nWe decided to move forward with having both pages visible. However, we placed them side-by-side to better fit in the Webflow Designer window area. We brought in the style of the darker box to display the generated variables to match the rest of our UI.\n\n\n\nFinal Iteration\nThis is the final Figma iteration before our final UI design! Here, we focused on using UI elements to guide users through the steps they needed to take. We added numbers to each side to establish an order of use.\nI also experimented with using button colors to guide users through the order of actions they should take. Blue buttons could be pressed, while grey buttons would be locked.\nIn the first image, the single blue button would guide users to import or upload their .JSON file (first image). Next, the “Process .JSON” button would light up, encouraging users to press it (second image). Finally, with the .JSON processed, the “Create variables” button would unlock, successfully guiding users through uploading their selected variables (third image).\n\n\n\n\nFinal Figma UI\nAfter months of iteration from the first Figma mockups, I created the following Figma mockups of our final UI design.\nFor the Chrome Extension, I made sure to replicate small details like the loading wheel in the “Generating export .JSON” mockup, though I simplified our delete icon to one that was easier to create.\n\nFor the Webflow Extension, I replicated the three different states a user could encounter when processing their .JSON:\n\nA successful process\nCreating a variable collection to organize their new variables\nReceiving an error from one of their variables\n\nWe did not end up using the greyed-out buttons, though we continued using the numbered sections to guide the user.\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Live APIP\nBelow are screenshots of the actual APIP Chrome and Webflow Extensions. I collaborated with my team members to program the UI using Tailwind CSS, CSS3, and TypeScript. Special thanks to Erin for polishing the UI code!\n\nChrome Extension\n\n\nOpening Extension\n\n\n\nSelecting Elements\n\n\n\nDisplaying .JSON\n\n\n\n\nSee it in use!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebflow Extension\n\n\nOpening Extension\n\n\n\nImporting .JSON\n\n\n\nProcessing .JSON\n\n\n\nSuccessful Upload\n\n\n\n\nWondering where the gradient-style blue buttons came from? They are from Webflow! Throughout the design process of converting APIP to the Webflow style, I wanted to use the button styling found on the Webflow main site. After some digging using the inspect tool (and a little help from APIP), I was able to locate the button styling and use it here!\n\n\n\n\nLearnings\nThrough this project, I learned how to create mockups, wireframes, and user interfaces in Figma. With my design work, my teammates were able to have a guide when programming the user interface. My team and I successfully translated these Figma mockups into working code."
