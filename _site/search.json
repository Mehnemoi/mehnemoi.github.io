I designed a product for the user in POV #1 below.\n\nI was encouraged to consider extreme perspectives such as those with dedicated time for personal grooming or those who rarely engaged with it.\nI was given about a week to complete this assignment and document my process in a small accordion-styled journal. Images of some of the pages are included below."

My class split into small teams to conduct live on-the-ground interviews in the Claremont Village in Claremont, which has over 10 spas, barbershops, hair salons, and other personal grooming services.\nAfterward, I conducted 5 interviews with 5 different individuals to understand their process of getting ready in the morning. These interviews have been redacted for privacy reasons.\n\nFor instance, what facial products do they use, if any?\nIn what order did they complete tasks, and what tasks did they complete first?\nAnd, how would they describe their feelings about certain parts of these experiences?\n\nFrom these interviews, I documented 3 surprising and interesting quotes that I would use to help define needs for and insights from my potential users."

    "text": "Define\nIn the next step of the process, I used the insights I gained from my interviews to generate 3 needs from 3 different users:\n\nNeed # 1: A need to know how a skin care product will affect the skin before making an investment\nNeed # 2: A need to restore calm in the morning to destress the morning commute and view the day at a glance\nNeed # 3: A need for a collection of quick and nice hairstyles to do under a time constraint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these three needs, I generated two point-of-views (POVs) to understand who I would be designing for, their needs, and insight behind those needs to help formulate my final product.\n\nPOV #1: College Student\n[User] A 20-year-old young woman in college who manages and contributes to her household finances and cares deeply about the health of her skin.\n[Needs] To understand and feel confident about how a skin-care product will affect her skin before making the financial investment to try a new skin-care product.\n[Insight] Finding the right skin care product requires immense trial and error. Unlike makeup, skincare products don’t have in-store samples that produce immediate results. Thus, this is a potentially expensive process that may produce undesirable results and/or lead to wasted funds that can be otherwise allocated to things like household expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOV #2: Working Mother\n[User] A 50-year-old working mother whose morning routine ends once she arrives at work.\n[Needs] A way to maintain calm she establishes earlier during the commute portion of her routine.\n[Insight] Her morning routine spans a few hours from getting up to finally putting on lipstick at work. While she uses the Calm App to establish calm throughout the routine, it is not effective during the morning commuter portion as GPS interrupts it."

If you are familiar with Gradescope, you will notice the iconic Gradescope green used as a primary color throughout. I intentionally chose this color scheme to create a strong visual tie to the Gradescope platform for users. This visual tie would help communicate that Gradescope Calendar was to be used alongside Gradescope, rather than be separate from.\n\n\n\n\nColor palatte (Generated on coolors.co)\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin Page\nThis image includes the current UI of the login screen, as well as one of its previous iterations for comparision.\n\n\n\nLogin page\n\n\n\n\nMonthly Overview Page\nBelow are three versions of the Monthly Overview page: the regular mode, dark mode, and the first iteration of the design. On this page users can visualize all of the assignments due for the month, including a separate window for assignments due that week. Users can use the “view by class” buttons to view assigned items for a specific class only. They could then download the calendar data to import into the digital calendar of their choice.

The image below showcases the final version.\nBecause of how frequently I edit and update my designs, I have started a habit of keeping track of previous states. This helps me to understand how far the design has come and also have an accessible record of past assets I can use in later iterations. Most importantly, this frees me from being afraid of making major changes to the design - leading to more daring design decisions.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 1\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Version: This page displays items assigned to me earlier in the school year during the week of Feburary 6th, 2022. Here, I have highlighted all assignments from my “Introduction to Biology” class. I demonstrate the crossing-out option and checking-off functionalities.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome Page\nThis page did not end up being used, but would have served as the “face” of Gradescope Calendar.

    "text": "Background\nWelcome! This is a summer research project I collaborated on in Summer 2022. My team of 3 created a product called Gradescope Calendar to help with Gradescope assignment organization at the Claremont Colleges in California. Gradescope is a platform where teachers can assign homework, quizzes, and tests to students. Students can submit these through Gradescope and recieve detailed feedback. While Gradescope makes it easy to see when assigned items are due, these items are separated by classes. Thus, students must look at one class at a time in Gradescope and track assigned items using their own methods. Gradescope Calendar streamlines this process by presenting all assigned items for all classes on one screen. All though a similar project, Gradescope Scheduler, exists, our product promoted ease of use by not requiring users to use backend processes to access the information.\n\n\n\nSee the research poster I designed for the team to learn more about the project!\n\n\nI designed the UI for the site, but my main objective was to implement the Weekly Assignments page. This page displayed all the assign items due for a specific week, separated by the day. Users could:\n\nview past and future weeks of due dates for assigned items\nclearly see when the next assignment is due\n\nand the time remaining to submit it\n\ncheck off assigned items to highlight them\ncross out assigned items to strike them out and\nhighlight assigned items by course."

I knew how to make basic HTML elements like divs and buttons, and how to navigate to different pages. Beyond that, not much.\nLuckily, my research advisor set us up for success. My first assignment was to create a web app using Flask.\nMy Flask app began as a single page with a table holding information about characters from Sailor Moon, my favorite series. (picture). It then evolved to have multiple pages of content where users could. Throughout this process I learned how to:\n\ncreate a button that changed another element\nuse scripting to\n\nchange the title of a page\ncontrol the CSS properties using a button\nreverse an inputed string and output the result on the screen\n\ncall actions based on what is typed into a field\ncall APIs using fetch\ncreate a dynamically resizing page\n\n\nThe images and captions below demonstrate this process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beginning state of my wesbite. Just a table with characters from Sailor Moon and their superhero name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst major CSS update of my wesbite! Added more content to my table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpanded the site to have multiple pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded more pages to my site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded even more pages to my site and added a stary background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated widget where users can input image size dimensions and recieve a link to a cat picture with those dimensions from a cat image API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated another widget where users can input a color and have the background change to match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning how to add and create function checkboxes and radio buttons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor CSS update to the site, leaning into the space and science theme. Creating a dynamicaly responsive homepage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessfully implemented Anime Quotes API!\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\nTo test my newly learned skils, I wanted to create a page that can:\n\ntake in information\nuse text boxes\ndisplay something recieved from an API\n\nSee the images and captions below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst I created an initial form to take in formation. Implemented a check box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanged what information I would request from the user. Updated the UI to bring back the space element.\n\n\n\n\n\nImplemented dynamic resizing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal version of the Welcome page with a successful implementation of a random quotes API!\n\n\nThese skills were instrumental in my developlement of the Weekly Assignments page."
