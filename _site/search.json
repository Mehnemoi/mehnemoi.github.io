    "text": "Empathize\nMy project began with empathizing with potential users. My class split into small teams to conduct live on-the-ground interviews in the Claremont Village in Claremont, which has over 10 spas, barbershops, hair salons, and other personal grooming services. Afterward, I conducted 5 interviews with 5 different individuals to understand their process of getting ready in the morning. For instance, what facial products do they use, if any? In what order did they complete tasks, and what tasks did they complete first? And, how would they describe their feelings about certain parts of these experiences?\nFrom these interviews, I documented 3 surprising and interesting quotes that I would use to help define needs for and insights from my potential users."

    "text": "Define\nIn the next step of the process, I used the insights I gained from my interviews to generate 3 needs:\nUser # 1: A need to know how a skin care product will affect the skin before making an investment\nUser # 2: A need to restore calm in the morning to destress the morning commute and view the day at a glance\nUser # 3: A need for a collection of quick and nice hairstyles to do under a time constraint\nFrom these three needs, I generated two point-of-views (POVs) to understand who I would be designing for, their needs, and insight behind those needs to help formulate my final product.\n\nPOV #1: College Student\n[User] A 20-year-old young woman in college who manages and contributes to her household finances and cares deeply about the health of her skin.\n[Needs] To understand and feel confident about how a skin-care product will affect her skin before making the financial investment to try a new skin-care product.\n[Insight] Finding the right skin care product requires immense trial and error. Unlike makeup, skincare products don’t have in-store samples that produce immediate results. Thus, this is a potentially expensive process that may produce undesirable results and/or lead to wasted funds that can be otherwise allocated to things like household expenses.\n\n\nPOV 2: Working Mother\n[User] A 50-year-old working mother whose morning routine ends once she arrives at work.\n[Needs] A way to maintain calm she establishes earlier during the commute portion of her routine.\n[Insight] Her morning routine spans a few hours from getting up to finally putting on lipstick at work. While she uses the Calm App to establish calm throughout the routine, it is not effective during the morning commuter portion as GPS interrupts it."

    "section": "Prototype",
    "text": "Prototype\nI generated a prototype for my POV #1 user. I designed a booklet that shared the price range of a skin-care product, a positive review, a review that suggests another product in the company line that may work better, an ingredients list with impacts on the skin, suggested other products, before and after photos for each user showcased, and a large picture of the product on the front so people can easily match it to the product.\nFor the second prototype, I would have liked to test the GPS navigation with the meditation voice integration. Here I would have explored the “maximize calm” portion of my solution for POV #2. If I went with this prototype I wondered: How might we clearly differentiate between the guided meditation and instructions if they are using the same voice? Furthermore, how might we ensure users are actively listening to the navigation the entire time?"

Additionally, she liked how with each key ingredient there was a description of why it was in the product and what it does. She thought it was easy to read."

I would have liked to go back to the ideate steps for POV #2 because I felt the Chat-GPT ideas were more of idea starters than ideas themselves. Each idea it presented felt like the body of a “How Might We” question."
