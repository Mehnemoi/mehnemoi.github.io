## UI Design
In this section you can see the UI designs I made for Gradescope Calendar. If you are familiar with Gradescope, you will notice the iconic Gradescope green used as a primary color throughout. I intentionally chose this color scheme to **create a strong visual tie to the Gradescope platform** for users. This visual tie would help communicate that Gradescope Calendar was to be used alongside Gradescope, rather than be separate from.

### Weekly Assignments Page

Here I showcase two iterations of the Weekly Assignments page. *The image below showcases the final version.*

 Because of how frequently I edit and update my designs, I have started a **habit of keeping track of previous states**. This helps me to understand how far the design has come and also have an accessible record of past assets I can use in later iterations. Most importantly, this frees me from being afraid of making major changes to the design - **leading to more daring design decisions**.
