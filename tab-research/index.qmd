## Diversity-Hire Narrative: Impacts and Mitigation Strategies [Published - ICER '23] 

::: {.proj-description}

*Christopher Perdriau, Vidushi Ojha,* ***Kaitlynn T. Gray,*** *Brent Lagesse, Colleen M Lewis*

:::

::: {.proj-description}

Published in ICER '23. Researched the diversity-hire narrative - the belief that someone received a job due to a part of their identity and not their skill. Explored who said this narrative, how it impacted those who heard it, and ways to prevent harmful effects from hearing this narrative. 

**What I did:** Qualitatively analyzed 23 interviews for themes and main ideas using SaturateApp. Proofread and edited our published paper. Presented our findings at my school's summer research symposium. Designed the layout for the research poster under "Poster PDF".
