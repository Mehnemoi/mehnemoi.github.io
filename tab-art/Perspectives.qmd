### Description
I created this piece to encourage myself to consider perspectives that were the opposite of my own. I researched the impacts of shifting perspectives and created a kaleidoscope, periscope, and red reveal to create optical illusions. With these, I could literally view the world in interesting new ways, and guide the audience to do so as well.

#### The (not so simple) Tower

![](assets/ART0_1.jpg){.lightbox}

:::{.screenshot-caption}
The piece begins with black spires constructed from laser cut wood painted black. In the background are two patterns framed in black, making the piece feel like a standard exhibit in an art mueseum. 

However, the towers are **more than they seem** -- one tower hides a **kaleidoscope**, another a **red reveal**, and another a deconstructed **periscope**!

#### Transforming Interactions

:::{.screenshot-caption}
The black spires can be pressed together to create new shapes. Audiences are encouraged to manipulate the tower pieces and look through them to see their world transformed. 

The pieces are created to allow audiences to combine the red reveal, kaleidoscope, and periscope in a variety of ways to layer their effects!

A look through the red reveal at one of the pattern pieces on the wall. This reveals a message about how optical illusions impact humans.

#### Through the Kaleidoscope

Looking through the kaleidoscope at another of the patterned pieces shatters its initial look and allows the audience to spin and break the pattern in new ways.

#### Through the Periscope

:::{.screenshot-caption}
A look through the periscope! We can see the patterned piece above through the viewing port. Since the pieces are like building blocks, audiences can rotate one or both of the pieces holding the mirror to see in different directions, even to see behind themselves!
