### Description
I created this piece to encourage myself to consider perspectives that were the opposite of my own. I researched the impacts of shifting perspectives and created a kaleidoscope, periscope, and red reveal to create optical illusions. With these, I could literally view the world in interesting new ways, and guide the audience to do so as well.
