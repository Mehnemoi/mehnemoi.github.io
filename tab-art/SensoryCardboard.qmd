### Description
What comes to mind when you think about something light or animated or squishy? How would you represent that in physical form? In this project, I was tasked to create physical representations of the concept of light, animated, and squishy. The catch: I could only use cardboard, foamcore, paper, and glue!


#### Animated
When I think of something animated, I think of movement and
changing expressions. Thus, I used dowels made from rolled
paper and glue to create a piece with moving wings and a
scrollable face wheel to generate 4 different expressions.

#### Light
I took a more literal representation for this piece and created the
Sun as it is a provider of light. I included a hole within to allow light
to pass through the object, and rainbow-order metallic coated
paper to represent how light is colorful and reflective (which, when
combined with a phone flashlight leads to some cool reflections!).

#### Squishy
For this piece, I wanted to create something that could be physically
squeezed. My final design is a pillow that can be squeezed or fluffed
due to the form of the foam core inside the “pillow case.”
