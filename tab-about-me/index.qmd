::: {.about-me}
I'm a recently graduated **Computer Science major + Art concentration** from Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA. (I took a lot of design classes as well).
:::



::: {.asides}
Harvey Mudd? Think of a small, liberal arts STEM school known for student collaboration
:::



::: {.about-me}
My favorite projects have a strong technical and artistically creative component. Design projects are this golden mix of this. 

But I also love research.
:::


::: {.asides}
It's why I’ve spent all three summers in college doing research.
:::

::: {.about-me}
I am drawn to projects with a human-centered focus - I am deeply curious about how products and systems impact the people interacting with them.
:::

::: {.asides}
That’s broad, yes! But it allows me to apply it to a multitude of projects. Whatever project I am on, I am going to care about the humans involved.
:::

::: {.about-me}
I thrive in team-based projects where I am in charge of the visuals of a project - specifically making sure information is communicated clearly and aesthetically. 

I love taking the knowledge I gained and turning it into a visual document so that others can appreciate these findings.

For me, design isn’t just about making things pretty; it is about creating a product that most effectively reflects the person, people, or community I am designing for. I do this by valuing the feedback of my clients.

::: {.about-me-text}
You'll most likely find me reading, [drawing](/tab-art/Sketches.qmd), playing *Sky: Children of the Light*, or watching anime (if I'm not wonderfully lost in hours of updating the SCSS on this site).

Picture: my character in the game *Sky*!
