This is a summer research project I collaborated on in Summer 2022. My team of 3 created a product called Gradescope Calendar to help with Gradescope assignment organization at the Claremont Colleges in California. Gradescope is a platform where teachers can assign homework, quizzes, and tests to students. Students can submit these through Gradescope and recieve detailed feedback. While Gradescope makes it easy to see when assigned items are due, these items are separated by classes. Thus, students must look at one class at a time in Gradescope and track assigned items using their own methods. Gradescope Calendar streamlines this process by presenting all assigned items for all classes on one screen. All though a similar project, Gradescope Scheduler, exists, our product promoted ease of use by not requiring users to use backend processes to access the information.\n\n![See the research poster I designed for the team to learn more about the project!](images/GCalResearchPoster.png){.lightbox}\n\nI designed the UI for the site, but my main objective was to implement the Weekly Assignments page. This page displayed all the assign items due for a specific week, separated by the day. Users could:\n\n* view past and future weeks of due dates for assigned items\n* clearly see when the next assignment is due\n    + and the time remaining to submit it\n* check off assigned items to highlight them\n* cross out assigned items to strike them out and\n* highlight assigned items by course.\n\n\n\n## UI Design\n\n::::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column}\nIn this section you can see the UI designs I made for Gradescope Calendar using Canva. If you are familiar with Gradescope, you will notice the iconic Gradescope green used as a primary color throughout. I intentionally chose this color scheme to **create a strong visual tie to the Gradescope platform** for users. This visual tie would help communicate that Gradescope Calendar was to be used alongside Gradescope, rather than be separate from.\n:::\n\n::: {.column}\n![Color palatte (Generated on coolors.co)](images/GCalColorPal.png){.lightbox}\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n\n### Login Page\nThis image includes the current UI of the login screen, as well as one of its previous iterations for comparision.\n\n![Login page](images/GCalLoginUI.png){.lightbox}\n\n### Monthly Overview Page\nBelow are three versions of the Monthly Overview page: the regular mode, dark mode, and the first iteration of the design. On this page users can visualize all of the assignments due for the month, including a separate window for assignments due that week. Users can use the \"view by class\" buttons to view assigned items for a specific class only. They could then download the calendar data to import into the digital calendar of their choice. Or, they could navigate the weekly assignents page!\n\n![Regular UI](images/GCalCalendarRegUI.png){.lightbox}\n\n::::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column}\n\n![Dark mode](images/GCalCalendarDarkUI.png){.lightbox}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column}\n\n![Initial design](images/GCalInitial.png){.lightbox}\n\n:::\n:::::\n\n### Weekly Assignments Page\n\n::::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column}\nHere, I showcase three iterations of the Weekly Assignments page. *The image below showcases the final version.*\n\n Because of how frequently I edit and update my designs, I have started a **habit of keeping track of previous states**. This helps me to understand how far the design has come and also have an accessible record of past assets I can use in later iterations. Most importantly, this frees me from being afraid of making major changes to the design - **leading to more daring design decisions**.\n:::\n\n::: {.column}\n![Version 1](images/GCalWeeklyV1.png){.lightbox}\n\n![Version 2](images/GCalWeeklyV2.png){.lightbox}\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n![Final Version: This page displays items assigned to me earlier in the school year during the week of Feburary 6th, 2022.

I knew how to make basic HTML elements like divs and buttons, and how to navigate to different pages. Beyond that, not much.\n\nLuckily, my research advisor set us up for success. My first assignment was to create a web app using Flask.\n\nMy Flask app began as a single page with a table holding information about characters from Sailor Moon, my favorite series. (picture). It then evolved to have multiple pages of content where users could. Throughout this process I learned how to:\n\n* create a button that changed another element\n* use scripting to\n    + change the title of a page\n    + control the CSS properties using a button\n    + reverse an inputed string and output the result on the screen\n* call actions based on what is typed into a field\n* call APIs using fetch\n* create a dynamically resizing page\n\n<!-- All within 9 days! Learning how to call APIs took the longest amount of time. -->\n\nThe images and captions below demonstrate this process:\n\n::: {#webdev layout-ncol=3}\n\n![The beginning state of my wesbite.
