::: {.about-me}
I'm a **Computer Science** major + Art concentration at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA. (I take a lot of design classes as well).
:::

::: {.asides}
Harvey Mudd? Think of a small, liberal arts STEM school known for student collaboration
:::

::: {.about-me}
My favorite projects have a strong technical and artistically creative component. Design projects are this golden mix of this. 

But, I also love research.

:::


::: {.asides}

It's why I’ve spent the last three summers doing research.

:::

::: {.about-me}

I am drawn to projects with a human-centered focus - I am deeply curious about how products and systems impact the people interacting with them.

:::

::: {.asides}

That’s broad, yes! But it allows me to apply it to a multitude of projects. Whatever project I am on, I am going to care about the humans involved.

:::

::: {.about-me}
I thrive in team-based projects where I am in charge of the visuals of a project - specifically making sure information is communicated clearly and aesthetically. 

I love taking the knowledge I gained and turning it into a visual document so that others can appreciate these findings.

For me, design isn’t just about making things pretty, it is about creating a product that most effectively reflects the person/people/community I am designing for. I do this by valuing the feedback of my clients.

**I am creative, intelligent, driven, and curious.** 

If that sounds like the qualities of someone you’d like on your team, I’d love to connect.

I’ve been a graphic designer for the past five years. Creating graphics feels like a puzzle - it is very satisfying to learn new ways I can communicate information visually.

I enjoy spending long amounts of time understanding how people are impacted by things made by people or systems people live under. There is a publication or two in there...
